Current Project Status:

    🎥 Real-Time Video Processing (main.py)
    Person Detection & Tracking: Using PersonDetector + CentroidTracker

    Face Detection & Blurring: Privacy protection ✔️

    Posture Estimation: Lying/Sitting/Standing classification using mediapipe

    Demographics Detection: Age & gender estimation using OpenCV DNN

    Line Counter: Entry/Exit tracking ✔️

    Zone Grid & Heatmaps: For people density and zone-wise analysis

    Inactivity Detection: Based on position history

    Abandoned Object Detection: Based on prolonged stationary objects

    Email + WhatsApp Alerts: Alert system for fall, crowd, inactivity, object detection

    Logging: CSV + SQLite database

🌐 Dashboards
    Flask Dashboard:

        Web-based viewer with filters on camera_id, start_time, end_time

    Streamlit Dashboard:

        Rich visualization with filters (camera, posture, alert, time)

        In/Out trend charts, alert frequency, zone heatmaps, occupancy matrix

✅ Key Functional Modules Implemented:
    ✅ pose_utils.py, tracker.py, line_counter.py, db.py, object_detector.py, alerts.py

    ✅ posture_classifier.py: Includes PostureClassifier & DemographicsDetector

    ✅ All critical CSV & image outputs
